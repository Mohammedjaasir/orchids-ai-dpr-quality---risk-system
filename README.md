📌 Project Overview

The AI-Powered DPR Quality Assessment and Risk Prediction System is a full-stack web application that automatically evaluates the quality of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) and predicts potential risks using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This system helps government departments, infrastructure agencies, and decision-makers reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and identify risks early before project execution.

🎯 Problem Statement

Manual evaluation of DPR documents is time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone, often leading to:

- Poor project planning

- Cost overruns

- Delays and failures

There is a need for an intelligent, automated system that can analyze DPRs and provide quality scores and risk insights.

💡 Solution

This project uses AI + NLP + ML to:

- Analyze DPR documents

- Assess document quality

- Predict project risk levels

- Provide structured insights via a web dashboard
